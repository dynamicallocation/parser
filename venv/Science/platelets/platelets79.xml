<summary>  While spherical particles are the most studied viscosity modifiers, they are
well known only to increase viscosities, in particular at low concentrations.
Extended studies and theories on non-spherical particles find a more
complicated behavior, but still a steady increase. Involving platelets in
combination with complex fluids displays an even more complex scenario that we
analyze experimentally and theoretically as a function of platelet diameter, to
find the underlying concepts. Using a broad toolbox of different techniques we
were able to decrease the viscosity of crude oils although solid particles were
added. This apparent contradiction could lead to a wider range of applications.
