<summary>  The microstructure of the commercial alloy AA2195 was investigated on the
nano-scale after conducting a T8 tempering. This particular thermo-mechanical
treatment of the specimen resulted in the formation of platelet-shaped $T_{1}$
($Al_{2}CuLi$)/ $\theta^{'}$($Al_{2}Cu$) within the Al-matrix. The
electrochemically prepared samples were analyzed by scanning transmission
electron microscopy and atom probe tomography for chemical mapping. The
$\theta^{'}$ platelets, which are less than 2 nm thick, have the stoichiometric
composition consistent with the expected ($Al_{2}Cu$) equilibrium composition.
Additionally, the Li distribution inside the $\theta^{'}$ platelets was found
to equal the same value as in the matrix. The equally thin $T_{1}$ platelet
deviates from the formula ($Al_{2}Li Cu$) in its stoichiometry and shows Mg
enrichment inside the platelet without any indication of a higher segregation
level at the precipitate/matrix interface. The deviation from the ($Al_{2}Li
Cu$) stoichiometry cannot be simply interpreted as a consequence of artifacts
when measuring the Cu and Li concentrations inside the $T_{1}$ platelet. The
results show rather a strong hint for a true lower Li and Cu contents and
hence, supporting reasonably the hypothesis that the real chemical composition
for the thin $T_{1}$ platelet in the T8 tempering condition differs from the
equilibrium composition of the thermodynamic stable bulk phase.
