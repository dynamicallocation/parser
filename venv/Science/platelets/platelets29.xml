<summary>  We apply RISM (Reference Interaction Site Model) and PRISM (polymer-RISM)
theories to calculate the site-site pair structure and the osmotic equation of
state of suspensions of circular or hexagonal platelets (lamellar colloids)
over a range of ratios of the particle diameter over thickness. Despite the
neglect of edge effects, the simpler PRISM theory yields results in good
agreement with the more elaborate RISM calculations, provided the correct form
factor, characterizing the intramolecular structure of the platelets, is used.
The RISM equation of state is sensitive to the number of sites used to model
the platelets, but saturates when the hard spheres, associated with the
interaction sites, nearly touch; the limiting equation of state agrees
reasonably well with available simulation data for all densities up to the
isotropic-nematic transition. When properly scaled with the second virial
coefficient, the equations of state of platelets with different aspect ratios
nearly collapse on a single master curve.
