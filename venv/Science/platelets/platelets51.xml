<summary>  We present a new simulation method to calculate the free energy and the
chemical potential of hard particle systems. The method relies on the
introduction of a parameter dependent potential to smoothly transform between
the hard particle system and the corresponding ideal gas. We applied the method
to study the phase transition behavior of monodispersed infinitely thin square
platelets. First, we equilibrated the square platelet system for different
reduced pressures with a usual isobaric Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and
obtained a reduced pressure-chemical potential plot. Then we introduce the
parametrized potential to interpolate the system between the ideal gas and the
hard particles. After selecting the potential, we performed isochoric MC runs,
ranging from the ideal gas to the hard particle limit. Through an iterative
procedure, we compute the free energy and the chemical potential of the square
platelet system by evaluating the volume of the phase space attributed to the
hard particles, and then we find the coexistence pressure of the system. Our
method provides an intuitive approach to investigate the phase transitions of
hard particle systems.
