<summary>  I consider the ordering of dilute platelet additives when incorporated into
an end-grafted polymer brush. The competition between wetting interactions and
the anisotropic stress environment of the interior of the brush causes these
platelet additives to either remain suspended at the outer edge of the brush
laying flat against the brush surface (as bits of confetti at rest on the
ground), or to invade the interior of the brush in which case the platelets
stand end-on and in some cases protrude above the outer edge of the brush. The
orientation of the additives is controlled by the ratio of the diameter of the
additive to the thickness of the bare brush, as well as the ratio of
solvent-monomer and solvent-platelet interactions.
