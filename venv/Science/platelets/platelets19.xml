<summary>  Density functional theory is used to study binary colloidal fluids consisting
of hard spheres and thin platelets in their bulk and near a planar hard wall.
This system exhibits liquid-liquid coexistence of a phase that is rich in
spheres (poor in platelets) and a phase that is poor in spheres (rich in
platelets). For the mixture near a planar hard wall, we find that the phase
rich in spheres wets the wall completely upon approaching the liquid demixing
binodal from the sphere-poor phase, provided the concentration of the platelets
is smaller than a threshold value which marks a first-order wetting transition
at coexistence. No layering transitions are found in contrast to recent studies
on binary mixtures of spheres and non-adsorbing polymers or thin hard rods.
