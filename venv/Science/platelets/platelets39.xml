<summary>  Using simulations and theory, we show that the cubatic phase is metastable
for three model hard platelets. The locally favored structures of perpendicular
particle stacks in the fluid prevent the formation of the columnar phase
through geometric frustration resulting in vitrification. Also, we find a
direct link between structure and dynamic heterogeneities in the cooperative
rotation of particle stacks, which is crucial for the devitrification process.
Finally, we show that the life time of the glassy cubatic phase can be tuned by
surprisingly small differences in particle shape.
