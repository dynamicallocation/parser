<summary>  An effective pair potential for systems of uniformly charged lamellar
colloids in the presence of an electrolytic solution of microscopic co- and
counterions is derived. The charge distribution on the discs is expressed as a
collection of multipole moments, and the tensors which determine the
interactions between these multipoles are derived from a screened Coulomb
potential. Unlike previous studies of such systems, the interaction energy may
now be expressed for discs at arbitrary mutual orientation. The potential is
shown to be exactly equivalent to the use of linearized Poisson-Boltzmann
theory.
