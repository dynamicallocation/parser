<summary>  Using Z-scan and dynamic light scattering measurements we investigate the
nonlinear optics response of a colloidal solution undergoing dynamics slowing
down with age. We study the high optical nonlinearity of an organic dye
(Rhodamine B) dispersed in a water-clay (Laponite) solution, at different clay
concentrations (2.0 wt% - 2.6 wt%), experiencing the gelation process. We
determine the clay platelets self diffusion coefficient and, by its comparison
with the structural relaxation time, we conclude that the gelation process
proceeds through the structuring of interconnecting clay platelets network
rather than through clusters growth and aggregation.
