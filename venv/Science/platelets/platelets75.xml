<summary>  In this communication we investigate two dyes N,N' -dioctadecyl thiacyanine
perchlorate (NK) and octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (RhB) in Langmuir and
Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films with or with out a synthetic clay laponite.
Observed changes in isotherms of RhB in absence and presence of nano-clay
platelets indicate the incorporation of clay platelets onto RhB-clay hybrid
films. AFM image confirms the incorporation of clay in hybrid films. FRET was
observed in clay dispersion and LB films with and without clay. Efficiency of
energy transfer was maximum in LB films with clay.
