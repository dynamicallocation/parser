<summary>  When a blood vessel ruptures or gets inflamed, the human body responds by
rapidly forming a clot to restrict the loss of blood. Platelets aggregation at
the injury site of the blood vessel occurring via platelet-platelet adhesion,
tethering and rolling on the injured endothelium is a critical initial step in
blood clot formation. A novel three-dimensional multiscale model is introduced
and used in this paper to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable
platelets at the site of vascular injury under different shear rates of blood
flow. The novelty of the model is based on a new approach of coupling submodels
at three biological scales crucial for the early clot formation: novel hybrid
cell membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a
platelet, stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell adhesion
kinetics and Lattice Boltzmann submodel for simulating blood flow. The model
implementation on the GPUs cluster significantly improved simulation
performance. Predictive model simulations revealed that platelet deformation,
interactions between platelets in the vicinity of the vessel wall as well as
the number of functional GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors played significant
roles in the platelet adhesion to the injury site. Variation of the number of
functional GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors as well as changes of platelet
stiffness can represent effects of specific drugs reducing or enhancing
platelet activity. Therefore, predictive simulations can improve the search for
new drug targets and help to make treatment of thrombosis patient specific.
