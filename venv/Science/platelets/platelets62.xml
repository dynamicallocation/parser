<summary>  Experiments on single crystal Li$_X$FePO$_4$ (LFP) nanoparticles indicate
rich nonequilibrium phase behavior, such as suppression of phase separation at
high lithiation rates, striped patterns of coherent phase boundaries,
nucleation by binarysolid surface wetting and intercalation waves. These
observations have been successfully predicted (prior to the experiments) by 1D
depth-averaged phase-field models, which neglect any subsurface phase
separation. In this paper, using an electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model,
we investigate the coherent non-equilibrium subsurface phase morphologies that
develop in the $ab$- plane of platelet-like single-crystal platelet-like
Li$_X$FePO$_4$ nanoparticles. Finite element simulations are performed for 2D
plane-stress conditions in the $ab$- plane, and validated by 3D simulations,
showing similar results. We show that the anisotropy of the interfacial tension
tensor, coupled with electroautocatalytic surface intercalation reactions,
plays a crucial role in determining the subsurface phase morphology. With
isotropic interfacial tension, subsurface phase separation is observed,
independent of the reaction kinetics, but for strong anisotropy, phase
separation is controlled by surface reactions, as assumed in 1D models.
Moreover, the driven intercalation reaction suppresses phase separation during
lithiation, while enhancing it during delithiation, by electro-autocatalysis,
in quantitative agreement with {\it in operando} imaging experiments in
single-crystalline nanoparticles, given measured reaction rate constants.
