<summary>  There is extensive recent experimental evidence of spontaneous superlattice
(SL) formation in various II-VI and III-V semiconductors. Here we propose an
atomistic mechanism responsible for SL formation, and derive a relation
predicting the temperature, flux and miscut dependence of the SL layer
thickness. Moreover, the model explains the existence of a critical miscut
angle below which no SL is formed, in agreement with results on ZnSeTe, and
predicts the formation of a platelet structure for deposition onto high
symmetry surfaces, similar to that observed in InAsSb.
