<summary>  We give a criterion to test a non-biaxial behavior of infinitely thin hard
platelets of $D_{2h}$ symmetry based upon the components of three order
parameter tensors. We investigated the nematic behavior of monodisperse
infinitely thin rectangular hard platelet systems by using the criterion.
Starting with a square platelet system, and we compared it with rectangular
platelet systems of various aspect ratios. For each system, we performed
equilibration runs by using isobaric Monte Carlo simulations. Each system did
not show a biaxial nematic behavior but a uniaxial nematic one, despite of the
shape anisotropy of those platelets. The relationship between effective
diameters by simulations and theoretical effective diameters of the above
systems was also determined.
