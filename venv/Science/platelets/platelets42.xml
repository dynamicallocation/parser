<summary>  Density-functional theory is used to investigate the phase behavior of
colloidal binary hard-platelet and hard-rod fluids near a single hard wall or
confined in a slit pore. The Zwanzig model, in which the orientations of the
particles of rectangular shape are restricted to three orthogonal orientations,
is analyzed by numerical minimization of the grand potential functional. The
density and orientational profiles as well as the surface contributions to the
grand potential are determined. The calculations exhibit a wall-induced
continuous surface transition from uniaxial to biaxial symmetry for the
hard-rod fluid. Complete wetting of the wall -- isotropic liquid interface by a
biaxial nematic film for rods and a uniaxial nematic film for platelets is
found. For the fluids confined by two parallel hard walls we determine a
first-order capillary nematization transition for large slit widths, which
terminates in a capillary critical point upon decreasing the slit width.
