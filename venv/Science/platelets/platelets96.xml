<summary>  A method is presented for the sensing of ions by determining the
concentration of corresponding salts (KCl, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, FeCl3, FeSO4,
AlCl3) in water, based on Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
process. The principle of the proposed sensor is based on the change of FRET
efficiency between two laser dyes Acriflavine and Rhodamine B in presence of
different ions (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+). Nanodimensional clay
platelet laponite was used to enhance the efficiency of the sensor.
