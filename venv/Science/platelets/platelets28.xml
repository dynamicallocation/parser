<summary>  Swollen stacks of finite-size disc-like Laponite clay platelets are
investigated within a Wigner-Seitz cell model. Each cell is a cylinder
containing a coaxial platelet at its centre, together with an overall
charge-neutral distribution of microscopic co and counterions, within a
primitive model description. The non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for
the electrostatic potential profile is solved numerically within a highly
efficient Green's function formulation. Previous predictions of linearised
Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) theory are confirmed at a qualitative level, but large
quantitative differences between PB and LPB theories are found at physically
relevant values of the charge carried by the platelets. A hybrid theory
treating edge effect at the linearised level yields good potential profiles.
The force between two coaxial platelets, calculated within PB theory, is an
order of magnitude smaller than predicted by LPB theory
