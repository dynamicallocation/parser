<summary>  This study investigates the mode I intra-laminar fracture and size effect in
Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs). Towards this goal, the results of
fracture tests on geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT)
specimens are presented and critically discussed for three platelet sizes.
  The results clearly show a decrease in nominal strength as the specimen size
increases. This effect becomes more important as the structure size increases.
It is found that, when the specimen is sufficiently large, the structural
strength scales according to Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and the
failure occurs in a very brittle way. In contrast, small specimens exhibit a
more pronounced pseudo-ductility with a limited scaling effect and a
significant deviation from LEFM.
  To characterize the fracture energy and the effective length of the fracture
process zone, an approach combining equivalent fracture mechanics and
stochastic finite element modeling is proposed. The model accounts for the
complex random mesostructure of the material by modeling the platelets
explicitly. Thanks to this theoretical framework, the mode I fracture energy of
DFCs is estimated for the first time and it is shown to depend significantly on
the platelet size. In particular, the fracture energy is shown to increase
linearly with the platelet size in the range investigated in this work.
