<summary>  Motivated by the intriguing phase behavior of charged colloidal platelets, we
investigate the structure and dynamics of charged repulsive disks by means of
Monte-Carlo simulations. The electrostatic interactions are taken into account
through an effective two-body potential, obtained within the non-linear
Poisson-Boltzmann formalism, which has the form of anisotropic screened Coulomb
potential. Recently, we showed that the original intrinsic anisotropy of the
electrostatic potential in competition with excluded volume effects leads to a
rich phase behavior that not only includes various liquid-crsytalline phases
but also predicts the existence of novel structures composed of alternating
nematic-antinematic sheets. Here, we examine the structural and dynamical
signatures of each of the observed structures for both translational and
rotational degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss the influence of effective
charge value and our results in relation to experimental findings on charged
platelet suspensions.
