<summary>  We present a method for the investigation of gigahertz magnetization dynamics
of single magnetic nano elements. By combining a frequency domain approach with
a micro focus Kerr effect detection, a high sensitivity to magnetization
dynamics with submicron spatial resolution is achieved. It allows spectra of
single nanostructures to be recorded. Results on the uniform precession in soft
magnetic platelets are presented.
