<summary>  Strong magnetic barriers are defined in two-dimensional electron gases by
magnetizing dysprosium ferromagnetic platelets on top of a GaAlAs
heterostructure. A small resistance across the barrier is observed even deep
inside the closed regime. We have used semiclassical simulations to explain
this behavior quantitatively in terms of a combined effect of elastic electron
scattering inside the barrier region and E x B drift at the intersection of the
magnetic barrier with the edge of the Hall bar.
