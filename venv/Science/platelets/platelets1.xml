<summary>  We present large scale simulations of the diffusion constant $D$ of a random
composite consisting of aligned platelets with aspect ratio $a/b&gt;&gt;1$ in a
matrix (with diffusion constant $D_0$) and find that $D/D_0 = 1/(1+ c_1 x + c_2
x^2)$, where $x= a v_f/b$ and $v_f$ is the platelet volume fraction. We
demonstrate that for large aspect ratio platelets the pair term ($x^2$)
dominates suggesting large property enhancements for these materials. However a
small amount of face-to-face ordering of the platelets markedly degrades the
efficiency of platelet reinforcement.
