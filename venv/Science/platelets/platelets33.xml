<summary>  We study the temperature-dependent evolution of the octahedral tilt order in
a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric and its impact on the ferroelectric
properties. Using diffuse neutron scattering on a
0.964Na$_{1/2}$Bi$_{1/2}$TiO$_3$-0.036BaTiO$_3$ single crystal, we suggest a
model for the temperature-dependent nanostructure of this perovskite that
features chemically pinned tetragonal platelets embedded in the rhombohedral
matrix, often separated by a cubic intermediate phase. Our results show a clear
correlation between the squared thickness of the tetragonal platelets and the
dielectric permittivity. This is interpreted as a sign for increased
polarizability of the strained and distorted lattice at the center of the
tetragonal platelets.
