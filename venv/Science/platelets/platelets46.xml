<summary>  We investigate the competition between anisotropic excluded-volume and
repulsive electrostatic interactions in suspensions of thin charged colloidal
discs, by means of Monte-Carlo simulations and dynamical characterization of
the structures found. We show that the original intrinsic anisotropy of the
electrostatic potential between charged platelets, obtained within the
non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann formalism, not only rationalizes the generic
features of the complex phase diagram of charged colloidal platelets such as
Gibbsite and Beidellite clays, but also predicts the existence of novel
structures. In addition, we find evidences of a strong slowing down of the
dynamics upon increasing density.
