<summary>  We present a new computational method by extending the Immersed Boundary (IB)
method with a spectrally-accurate geometric model based on Radial Basis
Function (RBF) interpolation of the Lagrangian structures. Our specific
motivation is the modeling of platelets in hemodynamic flows, though we
anticipate that our method will be useful in other applications as well. The
efficacy of our new RBF-IB method is shown through a series of numerical
experiments. Specifically, we compare our method with the traditional IB method
in terms of convergence and accuracy, computational cost, maximum stable
time-step size and volume loss. We conclude that the RBF-IB method has
advantages over the traditional Immersed Boundary method, and is well-suited
for modeling of platelets in hemodynamic flows.
