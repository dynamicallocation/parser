<summary>  We present a general formalism for incorporating dislocations in Phase Field
methods. This formalism is based on the elastic equivalence between a
dislocation loop and a platelet inclusion of specific stress-free strain
related to the loop Burgers vector and normal. Dislocations are thus treated as
platelet inclusions and may be coupled dynamically to any other field such as a
concentration field. The method is illustrated through the simulation of a
Frank-Read source and of the shrinkage of a loop in presence of a concentration
field.
