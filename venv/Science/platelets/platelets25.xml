<summary>  The local dynamics of the lead-free relaxor
$0.964\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3-0.036\mathrm{BaTiO}_3$
(NBT-3.6BT) have been investigated by a combination of quasielastic neutron
scattering (QENS) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous
paper, we were able to show that the tetragonal platelets in the microstructure
are crucial for understanding the dielectric properties of NBT-3.6BT F. Pforr
et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 014105 (2016). To investigate their dynamics, ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using
$\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$ with 001 cation order as a
simple model system for the tetragonal platelets in NBT-3.6BT. Similarly,
111-ordered $\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$ was used as a
model for the rhombohedral matrix. The measured single crystal QENS spectra
could be reproduced by a linear combination of calculated spectra. We find that
the relaxational dynamics of NBT-3.6BT are concentrated in the tetragonal
platelets. Chaotic stages, during which the local tilt order changes
incessantly on the timescale of several picoseconds, cause the most significant
contribution to the quasielastic intensity. They can be regarded as an excited
state of tetragonal platelets, whose relaxation back into a quasistable state
might explain the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties of
NBT-3.6BT in the 100 GHz to THz range. This substantiates the assumption that
the relaxor properties of NBT-3.6BT originate from the tetragonal platelets.
