<summary>  We put forward a simple procedure for extracting dynamical information from
Monte Carlo simulations, by appropriate matching of the short-time diffusion
tensor with its infinite-dilution limit counterpart, which is supposed to be
known. This approach --discarding hydrodynamics interactions-- first allows us
to improve the efficiency of previous Dynamic Monte Carlo algorithms for
spherical Brownian particles. In a second step, we address the case of
anisotropic colloids with orientational degrees of freedom. As an illustration,
we present a detailed study of the dynamics of thin platelets, with emphasis on
long-time diffusion and orientational correlations.
