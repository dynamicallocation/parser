<summary>  A geometry-based density functional theory is presented for mixtures of hard
spheres, hard needles and hard platelets; both the needles and the platelets
are taken to be of vanishing thickness. Geometrical weight functions that are
characteristic for each species are given and it is shown how convolutions of
pairs of weight functions recover each Mayer bond of the ternary mixture and
hence ensure the correct second virial expansion of the excess free energy
functional. The case of sphere-platelet overlap relies on the same
approximation as does Rosenfeld's functional for strictly two-dimensional hard
disks. We explicitly control contributions to the excess free energy that are
of third order in density. Analytic expressions relevant for the application of
the theory to states with planar translational and cylindrical rotational
symmetry, e.g. to describe behavior at planar smooth walls, are given. For
binary sphere-platelet mixtures, in the appropriate limit of small platelet
densities, the theory differs from that used in a recent treatment L. Harnau
and S. Dietrich, Phys. Rev. E 71, 011504 (2004). As a test case of our
approach we consider the isotropic-nematic bulk transition of pure hard
platelets, which we find to be weakly first order, with values for the
coexistence densities and the nematic order parameter that compare well with
simulation results.
