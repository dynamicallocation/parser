<summary>  The early stages of clot formation in blood vessels involve platelets
adhesion-aggregation. Although these mechanisms have been extensively studied,
gaps in their understanding still persist. We have performed detailed in-vitro
experiments and developed a numerical model to better describe and understand
this phenomenon. Unlike previous studies, we took into account both activated
and non-activated platelets, as well as the 3D nature of the aggregation
process. Our investigation reveals that blood albumin is a major parameter
limiting platelet adhesion and aggregation. Our results also show that the well
accepted Zydney-Colton shear-induced diffusivity is much too low to explain the
observed deposition rate. Simulations are in very good agreement with
observations and provide quantitative estimates of the adhesion and aggregation
rates that are hard to measure experimentally.
