<summary>  Single crystal nematic elastomers undergo a transition from a strongly
ordered phase N to an "isotropic" phase I. We show that: (a) samples produced
under tension by the Finkelmann procedure are intrinsically anisotropic and
should show a small (temperature dependent) birefringence in the high
temperature I phase. (b) for the I-&gt;Ntransition via cooling there is a spinodal
limit but for the N-&gt;I transition via heating there is no soft mode at the
standard spinodal temperature. (c) the N-&gt;I transition is reminiscent of a
martensitic transformation: nucleation of the I phase should occur in the form
of platelets, making a well defined angle with the director.
