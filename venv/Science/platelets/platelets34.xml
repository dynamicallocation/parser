<summary>  We investigate the margination of microparticles/platelets in blood flow
through complex geometries typical for in vivo vessel networks: a vessel
confluence and a bifurcation. Using 3D Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we
confirm that behind the confluence of two vessels a cell-free layer devoid of
red blood cells develops in the channel center. Despite its small size of
roughly one micrometer, this central cell-free layer persists for up to 100
$\mu$m after the confluence. Most importantly, we show from simulations that
this layer also contains a significant amount of microparticles/platelets and
validate this result by in vivo microscopy in mouce venules. At bifurcations,
however, a similar effect does not appear and margination is largely unaffected
by the geometry. This anti-margination towards the vessel center after a
confluence may explain in vivo observations by Woldhuis et al. Am. J. Physiol.
262, H1217 (1992) where platelet concentrations near the vessel wall are seen
to be much higher on the arteriolar side (containing bifurcations) than on the
venular side (containing confluences) of the vascular system.
