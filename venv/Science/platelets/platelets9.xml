<summary>  This paper worked towards modeling blood platelets. Blood platelets, also
known as thrombocytes, play a key role in blood clotting which is a vital human
function. Furthermore, the role of these entities in strokes, myocardial
infarctions, and coronary artery disease add to the importance of blood
platelets.
  Analytical expressions for the structure of blood platelets in both their
inactivated and activated states were developed, beginning with randomized
two-dimensional models in polar coordinates. Weak frameworks in spherical and
cylindrical systems were then created. Next, using rotational matrices to
change the position and direction of a simple projection, useful, explicit,
parametric system of equations were attained in three-dimensional Cartesian
space which roughly approximate the structure of a blood platelet.
  Finally, a methodology to return the drag coefficient ($c_d$) for any
inputted set of blood platelet images was designed. This method was
incorporated into a C++ program returning the functional representation and
drag coefficient of any given platelet. This work has primary applications in
computational biophysics and fluid dynamics. Additionally, if the parameters of
the model are extended, there could be ramifications in other areas of
scientific modelling by connecting analytical expressions with instrinsic
characteristics.
