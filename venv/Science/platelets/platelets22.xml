<summary>  We discuss the design and implementation of a system for generating charged
multilayer graphene nanoplatelets and introducing a nanoplatelet into a
quadrupole ion trap in high vacuum. Levitation decouples the platelet from its
environment and enables sensitive mechanical and magnetic measurements. The
platelets are generated via liquid exfoliation of graphite pellets and charged
via electrospray ionization. A single platelet is trapped at a pressure of
several hundred millitorr and transferred to a trap in a second chamber, which
is pumped to UHV pressures for further study.
