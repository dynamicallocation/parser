<summary>  Interfacing atomistic-based with continuum-based simulation codes is now
required in many multiscale physical and biological systems. We present the
first results from coupled atomistic-continuum simulations on 190,000
processors. Platelet aggregation in the patient-specific model of an aneurysm
has been modeled using a high-order spectral/hp element Navier-Stokes solver
with a stochastic (coarse-grained) Molecular Dynamics solver based on
Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD).
