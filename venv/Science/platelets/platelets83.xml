<summary>  Periodic hematological diseases such as cyclical neutropenia or cyclical
thrombocytopenia, with their characteristic oscillations of circulating
neutrophils or platelets, may pose grave problems for patients. Likewise,
periodically administered chemotherapy has the unintended side effect of
establishing periodic fluctuations in circulating white cells, red cell
precursors and/or platelets. These fluctuations, either spontaneous or induced,
often have serious consequences for the patient (e.g. neutropenia, anemia, or
thrombocytopenia respectively) which exogenously administered cytokines can
partially correct. The question of when and how to administer these drugs is a
difficult one for clinicians and not easily answered. In this paper we use a
simple model consisting of a delay differential equation with a piecewise
linear nonlinearity, that has a periodic solution, to model the effect of a
periodic disease or periodic chemotherapy. We then examine the response of this
toy model to both single and periodic perturbations, meant to mimic the drug
administration, as a function of the drug dose and the duration and frequency
of its administration to best determine how to avoid side effects.
