<summary>  The strongest magnets for high-temperature applications are Sm-Co based
alloys characterized by a cellular microstructure with Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ cells
and SmCo$_5$ precipitates, intersected by elongated Zr-rich platelets. This
elaborate geometry endows the material with remarkable magnetic hardness
because it constitutes a dense domain-wall-pinning network. A precise
understanding of the pinning mechanisms could enable the formation of stronger
Sm-Co magnets, but experiment and theory have not yet converged to a unified
model. Here, we show by comparing high-resolution Lorentz microscopy and
micromagnetic simulations that the magnetization processes in Sm-Co magnets are
an interplay between curling instabilities and pinning effects. Specifically,
domain walls are nucleated at the intersections between Zr-rich platelets and
Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ cells, and become pinned at the SmCo$_5$ precipitates, through
which they can tunnel only via the Zr-rich platelets. Further, we have observed
exotic domain-wall structures, such as topologically non-trivial 2{\pi} and
3{\pi} domain walls involved in domain-wall annihilation. Based on our
findings, we propose how the microstructure of Sm-Co magnets could be optimized
to increase the coercivity and remanence of the Sm-Co magnets.
