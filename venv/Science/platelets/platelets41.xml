<summary>  We use a Fundamental-Measure density functional for hard board-like
polydisperse particles, in the restricted-orientation approximation, to explain
the phase behaviour of platelet colloidal suspensions studied in recent
experiments. In particular, we focus our attention on the behavior of the total
packing fraction of the mixture, $\eta$, in the region of two-phase
isotropic-nematic coexistence as a function of mean aspect ratio,
polydispersity and fraction of total volume $\gamma$ occupied by the nematic
phase. In our model, platelets are polydisperse in the square section, of side
length $\sigma$, but have constant thickness $L$ (and aspect ratio
$\kappa\equiv L/&lt;\sigma&gt;&lt;1$, with $&lt;\sigma&gt;$ the mean side length). Good
agreement between our theory and recent experiments is obtained by mapping the
real system onto an effective one, with excluded volume interactions but with
thicker particles (due to the presence of long-ranged repulsive interactions
between platelets). The effect of polydispersity in both shape and particle
size has been taken into account by using a size distribution function with an
effective mean-square deviation that depends on both polydispersities. We also
show that the bimodality of the size distribution function is required to
correctly describe the huge two-phase coexistence gap and the nonlinearity of
the function $\gamma(\eta)$, two important features that these colloidal
suspensions exhibit.
