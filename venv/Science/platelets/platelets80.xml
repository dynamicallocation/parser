<summary>  Using methods of statistical kinetic theory parametrized with
first-principles interatomic interactions that include chemical and strain
contributions, we investigated the kinetics of decomposition and microstructure
formation in Al-Cu alloys as a function of temperature and alloy concentration.
We show that the decomposition of the solid solution forming platelets of
copper, known as Guinier-Preston (GP) zones, includes several stages and that
the transition from GP1 to GP2 zones is determined mainly by kinetic factors.
With increasing temperature, the model predicts a gradual transition from
platelet-like precipitates to equiaxial ones and at intermediate temperatures
both precipitate morphologies may coexist.
